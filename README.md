# PrimeRunner
Short and sweet prime number game. Live application can be found at http://primerunner.herokuapp.com

First ever developped application -- an attempt to implement basic client-server communications with a persisting database utilizing Express/NodeJS for the server, plain JS for the client (lil bit of JQuery here and there), and MongoDB for the database.
